// Transcript pairing buffer — B6 PR3 redesign (2026-06-21).
//
// Purpose: pair adjacent `tool_call` and `tool_result` transcript
// entries by `tool_use_id` so the SubagentDrawer can render them as
// a single merged card (matching the main panel's `ToolCallCard`
// visual language). Without this layer, the drawer would show the
// call + result as two separate cards — visually noisy and
// inconsistent with the main panel.
//
// Layered on top of `TranscriptEntry` (from `stores/subagentRuns.ts`);
// the drawer's `transcript` computed reads the raw entries from
// `store.liveTranscript` / `run.transcriptJson`, then this module's
// `pairTranscript` produces a `BufferedTranscriptEntry[]` that the
// template iterates over.
//
// See `.trellis/tasks/06-21-redesign-subagent-drawer-entry-as-toolcard-style/prd.md`
// §"Technical Approach" for the design rationale and acceptance
// criteria.

import type { TranscriptEntry } from "../stores/subagentRuns";

// Re-export `TranscriptEntry` so the test file (and any other
// downstream consumer) can import it from a single place. The
// store remains the canonical source; this re-export exists
// only for the convenience of the pairing-layer test and
// future call sites that already pull from `transcriptPairing`.

/** Pair adjacent `tool_call` and `tool_result` transcript entries
 *  into merged cards. The pairing is order-preserving: a `paired`
 *  entry appears at the position of the matching `tool_result`
 *  (the call's position is absorbed into the result's card). A
 *  pending call that hasn't matched by the time `now - received_at
 *  >= PENDING_TIMEOUT_MS` falls back to `standalone` so the user
 *  sees a "未完成" card with a timeout hint.
 *
 *  This is a pure function — no I/O, no mutation of the input
 *  array. The `pendingFirstSeenAt` map is **mutated by the
 *  function** to track the wall-clock `received_at` of each
 *  pending call across invocations; the caller (the drawer)
 *  keeps a stable reference to the same Map instance so that
 *  re-invocations with advancing `now` can age out calls
 *  correctly.
 *
 *  The "received_at" is the timestamp at which a `tool_call` was
 *  FIRST seen (added to the map) — not the current `now`. This is
 *  the only way the 30s timeout can elapse between invocations:
 *  the caller re-invokes the function periodically with `now =
 *  Date.now()`, and the map's first-seen timestamps persist
 *  between calls. If we used `now` (the current invocation's
 *  timestamp) for `received_at`, every call would always be
 *  "just received" and would never time out.
 *
 *  Edge cases (locked by `transcriptPairing.test.ts`):
 *  - chat_event / permission_ask: always standalone (not
 *    pairable).
 *  - Orphan tool_result (no preceding tool_call): standalone,
 *    rendered as a regular result card.
 *  - Orphan tool_call that aged out past 30s: standalone
 *    "未完成" card. Pending calls within 30s stay as
 *    `pending_call`.
 *  - Two calls with the same `tool_use_id` (theoretical race
 *    where a tool_use is re-emitted): the second one overwrites
 *    the first in the pending map. The orphaned first call lands
 *    as a standalone entry on the next iteration. This is
 *    defensive — Anthropic never emits the same tool_use_id
 *    twice in one turn, but the buffer's per-id last-write-wins
 *    semantics keep us safe.
